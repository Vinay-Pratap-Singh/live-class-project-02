## **Topics I Learned** ##
>The important thing to which I come to know after doing this project is how I can use multiple images together.

>Usage of linear gradient and picture together is what I have used in this to make project background, which was a completly a new thing for me.

## **Time Taken** ##
>It takes me around 3 hours because I spend some time over learning the background property of CSS to use multiple images and stuffs.
